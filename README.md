# What is this?

Github released a new feature (Beta in the current date) that allows us save repositories to lists, **like we have in Spotify/Bandcamp/Youtube Playlists but now available here!** Saving a repository to some list count as a star, check the screenshots

_**So, this repository has a collection of list names and descriptions that you can create as your lists**_
